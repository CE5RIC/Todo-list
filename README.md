Alright, so I build a Todo list, and I know what you are thinking: "Isn't that a bit cliche?"
Wel yes, yes it is, but there is a reason for this of course. The concepts learned by building an application like this
are really important and set up an amazing foundation for your future React projects.

Components are an important aspect of React but furthermore I have learned a lot about state, props, using different
hooks and a bunch of other things.

Talking about those hooks, one of the trickiest and most important one to understand is the useEffect hook.
So what is it exactly? Well in short, useEffect is a tool that lets us interact with the outside world but
not affect the rendering or performance of the component that it's in.

So my foundation in React has been set, excited to learn more about this library going forward.

The best to going forward? Build more projects as practice makes perfect.

On to the next one!
